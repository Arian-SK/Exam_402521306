Im so happy to get this into this class.

ohh my dear firnds, what im saying.
i love Linux. its so good and del frindly. yes yes it maybe not so good and user frindly for some random people but
im a developer and when i start working its so good.

It give me tools that i need for  programming in a very easy way.
some time i code in low level lang like c or c++ and when i working with library in this lang it install and work 
with them so easy, it just need to call the apt to install and here we go...

also a very important point is its very light and good for week computer like my old laptop
and it is all costumizable??!
